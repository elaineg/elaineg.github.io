        <p>I couldn't wrap my head around the blockchain, no matter how many times I read the wikipedia page. It wasn't until I participated in a digital strategy case challenge about blockchain that I could understand it. The case challenge sparked my interest in digital strategy work, where I hope to build a career now. I wanted to bring this experience to other students like me.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>I joined the <a href="https://qcbt.ca" class="regLink">Queen's Conference on Business and Technology</a> to coordinate a case challenge independent of the main conference. Over the course of 4 months, I combed through LinkedIn and my personal network for contacts at digital consulting firms to whom I could pitch a partnership. I asked potential partners to write a case challenge that students could solve, to devote time to judging the submissions, and to host a final round event in their offices. In return, we could offer exposure to specialized talent, and increased brand awareness on university campuses. </p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>I called over 10 potential partners with this partnership pitch. After each call, I learned about the industry and improved my pitch to be more concise. Eventually, we secured <a href="https://ideacouture.com" class="regLink">IdeaCouture</a> as our challenge partner. IdeaCouture is a digital strategy firm owned by Cognizant, which is an international consultancy.</p>
        <p>Through this experience, I overcame my fears of calling strangers and asking for help on large projects. I learned how to utilize my network and my own communication skills to secure a partnership entirely over calls and emails.</p>
