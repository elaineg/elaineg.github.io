          <h2>Yearbook 2016.</h2>
          <p class="ftyb">I was given complete creative freedom as the editor-in-chief of my high  school yearbook. I began by brainstorming a theme that would reflect some standout events from the school year, such as the retirement of a veteran principal. The result was "Era", a beautiful, 256-page behemoth worthy of coffee table tome status. <br><span style="color: lightgrey;">Hover over images for more.</p>

        <h3>Bright Colours, Bold Lines.</h3>
        <p class="ftyb">The most prominent feature of "Era" was the thick, bold line that ran horizontally across each page - the timeline. Naturally, we displayed the year's events on the timeline in chronological order to simulate an era of time. In addition, each month was themed with a different colour. The obvious divide between sections and the eyeline across every page made for organized, easy-to-read content.</p>

        <h3>Dynamic Photos.</h3>
        <p class="ftyb">First and foremost, the quality of a yearbook is determined by its photos. We put a special emphasis on curating photos that displayed either motion or emotion. To capture these challenging spur-of-the-moment shots, we utilized advanced camera techniques and tools such as panning and Adobe Lightroom. The resulting photos are so crisp and candid, they come to life on the pages.</p>

        <h3>The End of an Era.</h3>
        <p class="ftyb">I wanted the cover to reflect both the school's student body and to introduce the theme. Taking a minimalistic approach, I left the cover entirely blank safe for "Era" on the front and "The End" on the back. I joined the two phrases with a subtle timeline to form the book's tagline, "The end of an era". Around these words I simply pasted greetings in different languages to reflect the ethnic diversity of our school's students.</p>
