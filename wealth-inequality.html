        <h3>Why I care</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I don't know when to file for tax returns. I have no idea how to pay for my student loans. I'm scared of using credit cards because I've received lots of negative messaging about credit debt. Having completed two years of a business degree in a finance specialization, I figured I should be in a good position to understand these basic personal finance topics. But I'm not. There was a good chance that my peers felt equally as unprepared to handle their presonal finances following 13 years of mandatory education.</p>

        <p>During my internship at <a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a>, I conducted extensive research to gauge financial preparedness within my peers. I found that students from wealthier backgrounds were more informed about personal finance management than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This creates a cycle where wealthier students stayed wealthy while poorer students struggle to reach financial stability.</p>

        <h3>What I'm doing</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>During my first year on <a href="https://qtma.ca" class="regLink">QTMA</a> as a product analyst, I was tasked to select an industry and argue why it would be first to be disrupted by technology. I chose to present a case for the financial services industry, and was validated when a panel of industry experts agreed it was most ripe for disruption. I am convinced that technology will democratize finance and alleviate financial inequality, so I plan to build my career in fintechs that share my vision.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a>, I created accessible content to educate Gen Z about basic financial topics. Eventually, Finn AI hopes to incorporate financial literacy content into their core product. I researched attitudes toward financial topics and I am more informed about when and why people seek to supplement their financial education. These learnings will inform how I develop financial literacy solutions in the future.</p>
