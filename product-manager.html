        <p>My university is located in Kingston, Ontario, which is a three-hour drive away from any major airport or Forever 21. It is costly to purchase train or bus tickets, so many students turn to carpooling as a cheaper alternative. However, the existing user journey to secure a carpool in and out of the city is full of pain points- It is done by sifting through unfiltered posts in a Facebook Group with 25,000 members. My <a href="https://qtma.ca" class="regLink">QTMA</a> product team wanted to fix that.</p>

        <p>As product manager, I guided a senior and junior developer through product design sprints, development sprints, prioritized backlog tasks, and developed presentations with two junior analysts to communicate our product value to external stakeholders.</p>

        <p>My team completed a live, functional MVP. QTMA hosted a demo day and invited product managers from Wealthsimple, Shopify, and TrendMicro to watch all product teams compete for imaginary venture capital. My product team received the most amount of funding.</p>
