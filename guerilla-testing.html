        <p>The goal of my summer project at <a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a> was to create an effective tool to teach consumers aged 15-25 about basic personal finance topics. To align this tool with consumer needs, we had to determine which financial topics were most concerning to them.</p>

        <p>I bussed out to the nearest university campus and wandered the hallways randomly looking for students of different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. I asked them to identify financial topics that concerned them. I also reached out to peers within my network from different countries and peers who did not attend post-secondary school.</p>

        <h3>results</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>We used these responses to gather insights and learnings about general attitudes toward personal finance. For example, we found that most were only concerned about topics that were immediately applicable to them. This means that very few peers are prepared to manage their personal finances until they are thrown into them. We hypothesized that an effective education tool would enable users to pull action-oriented advice when they needed immediate assistance about a financial topic.</p>
        <p>I learned how to ask strangers for help, design a guerilla test to minimize biases, and extract insights from the qualitative data.</p>
        <p>Consistent financial topics of concern across all backgrounds were budgeting, credit score, saving, and paying back loans or debt. View the full findings and insights report <a href="css/guerillatesting.pdf" class="regLink">here</a>.</p>
