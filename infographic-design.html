        <p>My summer project at <a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a> involved creating accessible content to educate Gen Z about basic financial topics. I like infographics because they present information in a bite-sized, easily digestible format.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>I researched the basics that students should know about credit cards, designed a set of infographics to include all the information, and asked 9 peers to evaluate my work for feedback regarding organization, clarity, and effectiveness.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row description">
        <h3>Results</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Peer feedback confirmed that infographics were a more engaging way to receive information than traditional learning materials found on the web, such as bank websites or Wikipedia articles. I also received feedback that I should design a clear path to navigate through an infographic, like a flowchart. This feedback will improve my infographics in the future. 100% of the 18 peers I asked would choose to learn about other financial topics in the same format, and 94% said that, to their knowledge, it was better than any alternative on the web.</p>
        <p>Here is the full set of infographics:</p>
