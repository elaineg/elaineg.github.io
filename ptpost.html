              <p style="font-size:18px"><em>The Pinetree Post</em> is a student-run publication that releases a new 20-30 page issue every month. It features articles and editorials about upcoming and past school events, as well as community and/or global issues. A fan favourite was an editorial advice column called "Ask Felix", which was written by everybody on staff except for our president, Felix. For my extensive knowledge in print publication design, I was recruited as the layout designer and put in charge of creating each issue with the given articles. On average, each issue took around 20 hours to create. <span style="color: lightgrey;">Click layout below for sample issue.</span></p>

              <br>
              <p style="font-size:18px">Newspaper layouts are designed to be unobtrusive and completely content focused, so continuity and simplicity of all elements is essential. Teamwork was central to this project: I discussed the appropriate photos and article lengths with each writer, and acted as a liaison between regular journalists and the editor-in-chief. I collaborated with the graphics designer to come up with the defining characteristics of the magazine's look: angular sans-serifs, and straight lines. The lack of added decorations makes for a layout that is clean and easy to read.</p>
