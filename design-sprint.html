        <p><a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a> is targeting credit card users with a new conversational assistant product for banks. This is a substantial market- 90% of Canadians own a credit card and 47% of us make more than half our purchases using credit <em>(PaymentsCanada, 2016)</em>. We conducted a design sprint to pinpoint how a conversational assistant for a credit card could be most useful to consumers.</p>

        <p>Our design sprint consisted of an empathy session, where we identified assumptions about consumer behavior that required user testing to confirm. Next, we completed multiple rapid prototyping rounds, and we picked the prototypes that garnered the most "energy" from sprint participants.</p>
        <p>The prototype with the highest energy was a conversational assistant to reassure and guide users through a situation where they lost their credit card. Over the following two weeks, we created a working demo of a conversational lost card manager, which required conversation design, user journey design, and development work. We used the demo to test participants and gather learnings about usage behaviour. The learnings confirmed that users felt this conversational assistant was a useful and reassuring tool in a lost credit card situation.</p>

        <p>We brought the conversational lost credit card manager to Visa Canada and secured a partnership to develop a commercial product using their developer APIs. Finn AI will be selling this card manager to banks, who will be deploying this product to their customers.</p>
