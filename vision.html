        <h3>Why I care</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I forgot to file for tax returns last year. I have no idea how to pay for my student loans. I'm probably a little dependent on my credit card. Having completed two years of a finance-heavy business degree, I figured I should be in a good position to manage these basic personal finance areas. But I'm not.</p>

        <p>Given my lack of knowledge, I felt there was a good chance that my peers felt equally as unprepared to handle their presonal finances following 13 years of mandatory education. So I did some research.</p>

        <p>During my internship at <a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a>, I surveyed students to gauge financial preparedness within my peers. I found that students from wealthier backgrounds were more informed about personal finance management than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This creates a cycle where wealthier students stayed wealthy while poorer students struggle to reach financial stability.</p>

        <h3>What I'm doing</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>During my first year on <a href="https://qtma.ca" class="regLink">QTMA</a> as a product analyst, I was tasked to select an industry and argue why it would be first to be disrupted by technology. I chose to present a case for the financial services industry, and was validated when a panel of industry experts agreed it was most ripe for disruption. I am convinced that technology will democratize finance and alleviate financial inequality, so I plan to build my career in fintechs that share my vision.</p>

        <p>At <a href="https://finn.ai" class="regLink">Finn AI</a>, I created accessible content to educate Gen Z about basic financial topics. Eventually, Finn AI hopes to incorporate financial literacy content into their core product. I researched attitudes toward financial topics and I am more informed about when and why people seek to supplement their financial education. These learnings will inform how I develop financial literacy solutions in the future.</p>
