        <p>I signed up for an undergraduate stock pitch challenge. I had little knowledge of equity research prior, but wanted to understand market forces, learn to use the Bloomberg terminal, and personally value a company.</p>

        <p>I had been regularly attending stock pitch and market update presentations hosted by student clubs throughout the school year, where I learned methods to identify an undervalued stock. I settled on HanesBrands- The company has been manufacturing undergarments for over 100 years and is found in 80% of American households. I felt the company was currently undervalued because investors were losing faith in the company's growth, despite innovations in its global supply chain that were driving costs down lower than all the competitors.</p>

        <p>Over the course of two weeks I learned to use the Bloomberg terminal, sought online courses to conduct both a DCF and comparable valuation, and finished a slide deck deliverable to showcase my findings.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>My submission was not selected as a top 10 finalist, but I requested and received feedback to construct a more cohesive investment hypothesis in the future. I learned to tell my stories with numbers- quantitative research findings are often more effective than qualititative findings, which is something I apply to research projects now.</p>
        <p>The submissions judges noted my interest in improving my research and arguments. They offered to refer me into an equity research role as a summer internship.</p>
